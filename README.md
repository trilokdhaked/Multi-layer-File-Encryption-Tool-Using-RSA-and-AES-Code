# Multi-layer File Encryption Tool Using RSA and AES

## Introduction

This is a project that implements a multi-layer file encryption tool using RSA and AES encryption algorithms. The tool is designed to provide robust security for sensitive data by employing a combination of RSA for asymmetric encryption and AES for symmetric encryption.

## Features

- **Multi-layer Encryption:** Files are encrypted using both RSA and AES encryption algorithms in multiple layers for enhanced security.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface:** A user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) makes it easy for users to encrypt and decrypt files.
- **File Integrity:** The tool ensures the integrity of the encrypted files, making sure they cannot be tampered with.
- **Key Management:** The project includes functionality for key generation, management, and storage.
- **Cross-Platform:** This tool is designed to work on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
